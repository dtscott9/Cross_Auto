        <h2>Where Small Town Values Endure</h2>
        <p>
          At Cross Auto, our commitment to maintaining small town values means
          that our customers always come first. We'll do more than simply sell
          you a car. We help you through every step of the process from helping
          you find the perfect new or used vehicle, to making sure your buying
          experience was nothing but exceptional after you leave our dealership.
          From scheduling a test drive or service appointment, to to helping you
          with finance options, Cross Auto is excited to help you find the car
          of your dreams.
        </p>
        <h2>About Our Dealership</h2>
        <p>
          The team at Cross Auto still believes in small town valuesâ€”things like
          hard work, fairness, and giving back to our community. That means we
          focus on our customers and their car-buying experience, not like other
          dealerships only concerned with selling cars at the highest price. Our
          sales team listens to customers and works with them to help them find
          the perfect vehicle for their needs at a great price. We also work
          with local banks to offer our customers competitive financing so cars,
          trucks and SUVs cost less. Cross Auto even calls every customer to
          make sure they had a great experience! And when you need service,
          parts or accessories, our team of certified technicians and advisors
          is there to help you understand how to keep your vehicle running at
          its best. So come see us today in Rigby, ID and see why our small town
          values have made us the fastest growing dealership group in Southeast
          Idaho!

        <h2>Dealership History</h2>
        <p>
          Grant Cross was born and raised in Southeast Idaho, where he worked
          his way from selling western wear to building a chain of RV
          dealerships to becoming President of one of the United States' largest
          RV Corporations. After deciding to leave the RV world to establish a
          family business in the car industry, he opened his first location in
          Rigby in 2008. Owing to the success and reputation of the dealership
          in Rigby, the family business expanded into a second dealership,
          opened in Blackfoot in 2016. Today, with sales and certified service
          departments working hard to provide exceptional customer service, they
          are the fastest growing dealership group in Southeast Idaho.
